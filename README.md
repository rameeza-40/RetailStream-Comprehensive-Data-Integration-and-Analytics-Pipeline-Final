# üìä RetailStream - Comprehensive Data Integration and Analytics Pipeline

**Author:** Your Name  

RetailStream is a **data engineering pipeline** that integrates data from multiple retail sources (CSV, JSON, API), validates and cleans it, stores raw data in **MongoDB**, processes and aggregates it, and finally loads the results into **PostgreSQL RDS** for analytics and dashboarding.  

This project demonstrates **end-to-end ETL workflow** using Python, Pandas, MongoDB, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL.

## üöÄ Features
- Ingests data from **CSV, JSON, and API** sources.  
- **Validates & cleans** retail transactions (removes duplicates, handles schema, formats timestamps).  
- Stores **raw data in MongoDB** for long-term archival.  
- Saves **processed & cleaned data** into CSV/Parquet (simulating AWS S3).  
- **Aggregates sales** by product (total sales, total quantity, average price).  
- Loads aggregated data into **PostgreSQL RDS** for analytics.  
- Includes detailed **logging** for tracking pipeline execution.
